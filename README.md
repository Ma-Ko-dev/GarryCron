MaCron is a simple, lightweight utility for scheduling python scripts on Windows systems. With MaCron, you can easily automate tasks such as backups, system maintenance, and data processing.

## Features
- Easy to use: MaCron uses a simple, intuitive GUI for defining tasks and schedules.
- Flexible scheduling: MaCron supports a wide range of scheduling times, including fixed intervals, and manual triggering.
- Error handling: MaCron provides robust error handling and notification features to ensure that your tasks run smoothly.
- Minimizes to Tray and runs in the background.
- Utilize Threads to ensure Scripts will run while the GUI is still responsive.

## Getting started
To install MaCron, simply download the latest build from the release section.<br>
Keep in mind that you need to have Python installed on your Machine. If the Scripts you are Scheduling with MaCron need non Built-In Modules, make sure that they are installed.<br>
It is recommended to save your python scripts with the extension .pyw to suppress the popup of a cmd window.

## Known Issues
The provided test scripts in the test_scripts folder might need additional Modules that are not listed in the requirements.txt file.
