# MaCron
This tool lets you run and Schedule your Python Scripts right from your PC.
<br>
Check out the Flowchart folder for some more or less useful Flowcharts. They are from the very beginning and helped me visualize my ideas and the workflow.
<br>
<br>
__This is a Work in Progress.__
<br>
Status: Prototyping
<br>
<br>
Planned Features (so far):
- GUI
- Scheduling of Pythonscripts
<br><br>

Limitations:
- Unknown for now

## Previews
The GUI is now fully dynamic. It will only show entries that are in the database and shows their name. I also finished the Add Dialog Design. Also: the buttons start to get functional ;)
